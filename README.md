# Web Development Project 3 - *Spanish Flashcards*

Submitted by: **Ashraful Mahin**

This web app: **is a Spanish language learning tool that utilizes interactive flashcards to help users improve their vocabulary. It presents users with a series of English words and challenges them to guess the Spanish translations. The app displays one flashcard at a time, allowing users to input their guesses and receive immediate feedback on their accuracy. Users can navigate through the flashcard set using "Previous" and "Next" buttons, and they have the option to flip each card to reveal the correct translation. The interface is clean and intuitive, featuring an input field for guesses, a submit button, and clear visual feedback on whether each guess is correct or incorrect. Built with React, the app offers a responsive design suitable for various devices, making it a convenient and engaging tool for beginners or anyone looking to reinforce their Spanish vocabulary skills through self-paced, interactive learning.**
